<h1>HI JOSH</h1>

<p>Welcome to your Wine Database thingy finally!</p>
<hr/>
<h2>ADMIN TOOL | EDIT THE DATAZ</h2>

<p>Hopefully in version 2 I can have you be able to edit the wines in here, but for now you will need to go to the admin area (off-site):</p>

<p><a href="http://winedb.zeuslocker.com/admin" target="_blank"><button>ADMIN PLACE WITH STUFFZ</button></a></p>


<p>Your username/password is in the README.txt file in the folder I e-mailed you. You should probably change it to something easier. If you forget it
I'll be able to set you a new one (because encryption etc)</p>


<hr/>
<h2>DATA SYNC</h2>

<p>After (or if) you use the above tool the <strong>data won't update automatically</strong>, because that makes it all slow and shit, so hit these buttons when
    you've updated things</p>

<p><a href="http://winedb.zeuslocker.com/data.json?refresh=true" target="_blank"><button>UPDATE SUNBURST DATA</button></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://winedb.zeuslocker.com/data-tables.json?refresh=true" target="_blank"><button>UPDATE DATA-TABLES DATA</button></a></p>
